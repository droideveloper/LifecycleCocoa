# Lifecycle (1.0.0-alpha)

Lifecycle Cocoa is a helper library that will observe values on ```Value<T>``` or ```MutableValue<T>``` which is as named mutable version of first one, and another feature of this is when you use ```AbstractViewController``` you can register callback Selectors for proper lifecycle concept it will called on expected lifecycle method.

  - Observe Values bound to change in future
  - Define proper functions or selectors for lifecycle (sequencial at the moment)

You can create your own type of Mutable type of Value by simple extending it.

### Tech

Lifecycle Cocoa uses method exchange if you know about it, it will replace proper lifecycle methods into defined ones and call original functions super. (aka swizzle)

### Install

```pod
    pod "LifecycleCocoa", :git => "https://github.com/droideveloper/LifecycleCocoa.git", :branch => "release/1.0.0-alpha"
```

### How to use

in your AppDelegate implementation.
```swift
AbstractViewController.setup()
````
then implement your controllers from AbstractViewController
```swift

class SomeController: AbstractViewController {
    
    // called when viewDidLoad lifecycle event occur
    @objc override func setUp() {
        register(.viewWilApppear, #selector(viewWillApearNext(_:)) // can take args but we send only one for now
    }
    
    @objc override func attach(_ animated: Bool) {
        // called when viewWillAppear(_ :) then
    }
    
    @objc override func detach(_ animated: Bool) {
        // callend when viewWiilDisapear(_ :)
    }
    
    @objc func viewWillAppearNext(_ animated: Bool) {
        // callend after attach(_:) invoked
    }
}
```
